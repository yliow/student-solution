\mychapter{101}{4000}{Asymptotics and algorithmic runtime analysis}

Open \verb!algorithm-analysis-how-fast-is-an-algorithm.tex!
and you'll see
\[
\verb!\input{exercises/runtime-of-sum-of-squares/main.tex}!
\]
Goto \verb!exercises/runtime-of-sum-of-squares/! and in that directory you'll
see \verb!question.tex! and \verb!answer.tex!.
\verb!question.tex! contains the question
and
\verb!answer.tex! contains the answer.
Near the top of \verb!answer.tex!, you'll see
\[
\textsc{Author: John Doe. Datetime: 2024-11-12 09:00:00}
\]

For the question you are working on, imitate the above example,
replacing John Doe with your name and datetime with the date and time
you are done.

To properly generate the table of contents you'll need to run make twice.
If you see some errors involving missing python code, let me know.

Once you are done, send me the directory of the exercise, tar'd and gzipped.
It should be a directory with \verb!main.tex!, \verb!question.tex! and
\verb!answer.tex!.
Retain the original directory name. 
For instance it might be
\[
\verb!runtime-of-sum-of-squares.tar.gz!
\]
You'll also need to tell me chapter and course.
